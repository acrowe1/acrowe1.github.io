Hello! This repository holds the code that was written and turned in for group 13 (The Power Rangers) in the Fall 2022 CSC 3380 class 
taught by Professor Charles Glass. It's a note taking webapp that has everything you'd need to keep track of/study for all of your 
classes that you may be taking or will be taking in the future. I hope you enjoy it!
